SONOS cells
-----------

The SKY130 process currently supports two SONOS flash memory cells:

-  The original cell is supported in the S8PFHD, S8PHRC and S8PFN-20 technology options, with operating temperatures from -55°C to +155°C
-  The “star” cell is supported in the S8PHIRS technology option. Its cell size is approximately 25% smaller than the original cell, but its temperature range is restricted to -40°C to +125°C.

Spice models for the memory cells exist for multiple conditions:
